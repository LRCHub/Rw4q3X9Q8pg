# Chic – São Paulo

> **歌詞登録ステータス：プレーン歌詞のみ**

```
Where the cross flashes red to
the street
And gasoline dreams of girls in
blue jeans
He's grazing the surface of
sleep
The vultures on main street are
eying you up
Calculating the weight of your
bones
And midnight graffiti appears on
your door
So we all can sleep safe in our
homes
And the storms in the distance
hold no rain
And I feel my resistance giving
way
Shelter me from this sky, dance
with me one last time
Sau Paulo rain, Sau Paulo rain
Do not disturb this blood red
earth
There's giants sleeping beneath
And carnival queens on their
deathbed scenes
All go through the motions of
grief
Take another hit, let the bottle
slip through
Your fingers and break like a
promise made
The day I remember, my heart I
will keep
My voice I surrender and I will
not speak to lie
We were so alive, we were so
alive
Shelter me from this sky, dance
with me one last time
Sau Paulo rain, Sau Paulo rain
Where the cross flashes red to
the street
And gasoline dreams of girls in
blue jeans
